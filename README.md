If you are going to recreate this tutorial on a Windows operating system as I did please take a look at a few of the links I have included they may help.

After adding Devise to my Gemfile and generating the devise views then creating my first user I received an error similar to "Cannot load such file bcrypt_ext".

I used ruby installer 2.3.3 and the devkit for 2.0 and higher versions from here http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
Unfortunately, I did not see/follow the installation instructions for the devkit https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit, so I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to run make install on windows.   

The link that helped me: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33588735/loaderror-cannot-load-such-file-bcrypt-ext-on-windows-2008-x64-server#34463580


Have a nice day,
